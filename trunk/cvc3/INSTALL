\section quickstart Quick Start

You can download a source distribution of %CVC3 from the
<a href="http://www.cs.nyu.edu/acsys/cvc3/download.html">CVC3 downloads
page</a>. Save the source archive as <code>cvc3.tar.gz</code> in the
directory of your choice and extract the contents using your favorite
archive program (you can use <code>tar xzvf cvc3.tar.gz</code> from a
terminal). This will create a directory containing the source of
%CVC3, normally called <code>cvc3-XXX</code>. In the following we will
denote the this directory as <code>$CVC3_SRC</code>. To build %CVC3,
open your favorite terminal program and run the following sequence of
commands

<pre>
   cd $CVC3_SRC
   ./configure
   make
</pre>

If any part of the build process fails, please read the following section for more information.

A successful build will create a library <code>libcvc3</code> in the
<code>$CVC3_SRC/lib</code> directory, and an executable
<code>cvc3</code> in the <code>$CVC3_SRC/bin</code> directory (these
are symbolic links to the actual files which are stored in
architecture- and configuration-dependent subdirectories). The
directory <code>$CVC3_SRC/test</code> contains an example program
using the %CVC3 library <code>libcvc3</code>. To try it out, run the
following commands in the terminal:

<pre>
   cd test
   make
   bin/test
</pre>

By default, <code>make</code> will build optimized code, static
libraries, and a static executable. To build the "debug" version (much
slower but with more error checking) use the following configuration
command instead:

<pre>
   ./configure --with-build=debug
</pre>

In case you prefer to build shared libraries (and thus a much smaller
executable), use the following configuration command:

<pre>
  ./configure --enable-dynamic
</pre>

If you do choose to buld the shared libraries, you must set your
<code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> environment variable to
<code>$CVC3_SRC/lib</code> before running %CVC3 or using the shared
libraries.

Alternatively, these and other options can be changed by editing the
<code>Makefile.local</code> file after running
<code>configure</code>.  However, be aware that re-running
<code>configure</code> will overwrite any changes you have made to
<code>Makefile.local</code>.

\section requirements Requirements

%CVC3 has the following build dependencies:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/">GCC</a> version 3.0 or later</li>
<li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/">Bash</a></li>
<li><a href="http://flex.sourceforge.net/">Flex</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/">Bison</a></li>
<li><a href="http://gmplib.org/">GMP</a> <em>(recommended)</em></li>
<li>A <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a> interpreter 
<em>(optional, for Java support)</em></li>
<li>A <a href="http://java.sun.com/">Java</a> compiler 
<em>(optional, for Java support)</em></li>
</ul>

All of these tools are available from common package repositories
(e.g., Debian, Ubuntu, Red Hat, Cygwin).

\section advanced Advanced Configuration

The configure script checks for the components needed to build %CVC3.
If for some reason, the configure script is missing or doesn't run on
your platform, you can recreate it from <code>configure.ac</code> by
running <code>autoconf</code>.

As the configure script runs, if something is not found, it
complains. configure looks for components in standard locations and
also uses several environment variables that you can set to help it
find things. In particular, you can set <code>CPPFLAGS</code> to
&quot;<code>-I $includeDir</code>&quot; if you have headers in a nonstandard
directory <code>$includeDir</code>, and <code>LDFLAGS</code> to
&quot;<code>-L $libDir</code>&quot; if you have libraries in a nonstandard
directory <code>$libDir</code>. Alternatively you can pass these
directories to the <code>configure</code> script using the following
command

<pre>
    ./configure --with-extra-includes=$includeDir --with-extra-libs=$libDir
</pre>

Run <code>./configure --help</code> for a list of all such environment
variables and options.

<h3>
GMP
</h3>

One of the components %CVC3 depends on is the GNU Multiple Precision (GMP)
library.  Many Unix-like distributions include gmp packages.

If you do not have GMP installed or your installation does not work, we
recommend that you install it manually:

1. Download the GMP source code from http://gmplib.org/

2. Unpack the sources, and from the root-directory of the GMP source code, run

<pre>
   ./configure 
   make
</pre>

   On some Solaris machines, you may need to configure GMP with
  
<pre>
   ./configure ABI=32
</pre>

   to make the resulting GMP library compatible with the %CVC3
   libraries.  The reason for this is that the default ABI that gcc
   chooses in %CVC3 compilation is not necessarily the default ABI
   that the GMP configure script selects, and one of them may need to be
   adjusted.

3. Now, either install GMP system-wide (make install), or supply the
   appropriate values for CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS to the %CVC3 configure script.

If for some reason, you do not want to use GMP, you can configure %CVC3 to use
native arithmetic by running:

<pre>
   ./configure --with-arith=native
</pre>

If you compile %CVC3 with native arithmetic, it is possible that %CVC3 may fail
as the result of arithmetic overflow.  If an overflow occurs, you will get
an error message and %CVC3 will abort.

<h3>
Java interface
</h3>

<em><strong>Note: The Java interface is experimental. The API may
change in future releases.</strong></em>

To build the Java interface to %CVC3, use the
<code>--enable-java</code> configuration option.  The configuration
script refers to the environment variables <code>JAVAC</code>,
<code>JAVAH</code>, <code>JAR</code>, and <code>CXX</code> to set up
the standard Java and C++ compiler commands. It refers to the
environment variable <code>JFLAGS</code> for default Java compiler
flags. It refers to the variable <code>javadir</code> for the
installation directory of the CVC3 Java library.

The configuration options <code>--with-java-home</code> and
<code>--with-java-includes</code> can be used to specify the path to
the directories containing the JDK installation and JNI header files,
respectively.

You must build %CVC3 as a dynamic library to use the Java
interface. For example, you might configure the build by running the
following in the top-level %CVC3 directory:

<pre>
    ./configure --enable-dynamic --enable-java
</pre>

<b>Note:</b> The Java interface depends on the "build type" (e.g.,
"optimized", "debug") of %CVC3. If you choose to re-configure and
re-build %CVC3 with a different build type, you must run "make clean"
in the current directory and re-build the interface (cleaning and 
rebuilding the entire %CVC3 package will suffice).

<h4>
Using the Java interface
</h4>

To access the library, you must add the file
<code>libcvc3-X.Y.Z.jar</code> (where "X.Y.Z" is the CVC3 version) to
the classpath (e.g., by setting the <code>CLASSPATH</code> environment
variable) and both <code>libcvc3.so</code> and
<code>libcvc3jni.so</code> to the runtime library path (e.g., by
setting the <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> environment variable
java.library.path JVM variable).

For example, to compile the class Client.java:

<pre>
    javac -cp lib/libcvc3-X.Y.Z.jar Client.java
</pre>

To run:

<pre>
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/cvc3/libs
  java -Djava.library.path=/path/to/cvc3/libs -cp lib/libcvc3-X.Y.Z.jar Client
</pre>

<h3>
.NET interface
</h3>

<em><strong>Note: The .NET interface is experimental. The API may
change in future releases.</strong></em>

A .NET interface to the %CVC3 library can be built using Visual Studio
2005 or later. To build the interface:

<ol>
<li>The lexers and parsers for the supported input languages need to be generated outside of Visual Studio. This can be done in two ways:
  <ul>
  <li>Use the lexer/parser files created by a Cygwin build. It suffices to run Make in <code>src/parser</code>: 
<pre>
./configure
cd src/parser
make
</pre>
</li>

  <li>Run the script <code>make_parser.bat</code> in directory <code>src/parser</code> with the native Windows versions of <a href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/flex.htm">Flex</a> and <a href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/bison.htm">Bison</a>.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Open the solution file <code>windows/cvc3.sln</code> in Visual Studio. The solution file contains the following projects (each with Debug/Release versions):
  <ul>
<li>cvc3lib: the C++ %CVC3 library</li>
<li>cvc3: the %CVC3 command-line program</li>
<li>cvc3test: tests for cvc3lib</li>
<li>cvc3libcli: the .NET %CVC3 library</li>
<li>cvc3cli: a C# clone of the %CVC3 command-line program</li>
<li>cvc3testcli: tests for cvc3libcli</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ol>

Each project can be built as usual with Visual Studio. Binaries will
be put in the folders <code>windows/release</code> (for Release
builds) and <code>windows/debug</code> (for Debug builds).

For more information, see the file <code>windows/INSTALL</code>.

<b>Note:</b> the .NET interface can only be used on Microsoft's CLR,
because Visual Studio produces <a
href="http://mono-project.com/CPlusPlus">mixed-mode assemblies</a>.

<h3>
Mac OS X
</h3>

Mac OS X uses <code>DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> in place of
<code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>.

On Intel Macs, by default, %CVC3 compiles in 32-bit or 64-bit mode
based on the compiler's default.  If you want to build as one or
the other in particular (for example, to match your libgmp
installation), put CXXFLAGS=-m32 (and JREFLAGS=-d32, if you are
compiling the Java bindings) in the environment when you run 
configure.

To run regression testing (make regress), you'll need GNU time.
We suggest you install MacPorts (from macports.org) and then the
"gtime" package.

You'll need also a libgmp installation.  libgmp can be downloaded from
gmplib.org.  If you install it in a nonstandard location (with
./configure --prefix=...) you'll need to give this location to CVC3
when you configure it:

  ./configure --with-extra-includes=...--with-extra-libs=...

or it may not find your installation of libgmp.

<h3>
 Cygwin 
</h3>

In order to use GMP on Cygwin, make sure the following packages are
installed: gmp, libgmp-devel, libgmp3, bison, flex, and make, as well
as standard UNIX tools.

On Windows, it's common to have directory names with embedded spaces.
This can be problematic for the CVC3 build system.  Therefore on
Cygwin we recommend symbolically linking to names without embedded
spaces, something like the following:

<pre>
  $ pwd
  /home/ACSys Group
  $ ln -s 'ACSys Group' /home/acsys
  $ export HOME=/home/acsys
  $ cd
  $ pwd
  /home/acsys
  $ cd cvc3
  $ ./configure --prefix=/home/acsys/cvc3.installation ...etc...
</pre>

On Windows, Sun's JDK doesn't install the Java compiler "javac" into the
standard path for executables.  If you want to build Java bindings,
you'll need to point CVC3 to it.  Again using symbolic linking as above:

<pre>
  $ pwd
  /home/acsys/cvc3
  $ ln -s '/cygdrive/c/Program Files' /programs
  $ ./configure --enable-java --with-java-home=/programs/Java/jdk1.6.0_16 ...
</pre>

Such symbolic linking (and in general using cygwin full paths) may cause
problems with non-cygwin programs.  In particular, if you have Windows
emacs installed (instead of cygwin's emacs), you have a version of etags
that may give errors at the end of the install.  These errors (about source
files not existing when in fact they do) shouldn't break the build (make
won't complain and bomb out; it's just that these are at the very end of
the build, so it looks like they are causing problems) and can be safely
ignored.

<h3>
 <a name="64-bit Platforms">64-bit Platforms</a>
</h3>

When building %CVC3 on 64-bit platforms, you must compile %CVC3 in the
same mode as any libraries it uses. For example, if GMP is compiled in
64-bit mode, then %CVC3 must compiled in 64-bit mode as well. The
configuration script will try to infer the correct compilation
settings. You can run <code>./config.guess</code> to see the default
platform type:

    $ ./config.guess
    i686-pc-linux-gnu

You can use the <code>--build</code> argument to
<code>configure</code> to override the default. For example, to
compile in 64-bit mode on a x86-64 CPU, you can use <code>./configure
--build=x86_64-pc-linux-gnu</code>.

<h3>
  LLVM
</h3>

<em><strong>Note: Compiling %CVC3 with LLVM is not supported and 
may cause runtime errors.</strong></em>

To compile with LLVM, run configure with the options:

<pre>
./configure CXX=llvm-gcc LIBS='-lstdc++'
</pre>

<h3>
Other Configuration Options
</h3>

Other configuration options include where to install the results of
"make install" (see below), what type of build to use (optimized,
debug, gprof, or gcov), and whether to use static or dynamic
libraries.  For help on these options, type

<pre> 
./configure --help 
</pre>

configure creates the file Makefile.local which stores all of the
configuration information.  If you want to customize your build
without re-running configure, or if you want to customize it in a way
that configure does not allow, you can do it by editing
Makefile.local.  For example, you can build a debug, gprof version by
editing Makefile.local and setting OPTIMIZED to 0 and GPROF to 1 (by
default, gprof runs with an optimized executable).  Note that for most
configuration options, the objects, libraries, and executables are
stored in a configuration-dependent directory, with only symbolic
links being stored in the main bin and lib directories.  This allows
you to easily maintain multiple configurations and multiple platforms
using the same source tree.

<h4>
 Additional make options
</h4>

To rebuild dependencies, type:

<pre> 
    make depend 
</pre>

To remove just the executable or libraries in the current
configuration, type:

<pre> 
    make spotty 
</pre>

To remove in addition all object files and makefile dependencies for
the current configuration, type:

<pre> 
    make clean 
</pre>

To remove all files that are not part of the distribution (including
all object, library, and executables built for any configuration or
platform), type:

<pre> 
    make distclean 
</pre>

To build a tarball distribution of the current source tree, type:

<pre> 
    make dist 
</pre>

\section installing Installing CVC3

To install %CVC3 system-wide, (assuming you have already run configure)
run:

<pre>
    make install
</pre>

Installation depends on two configuration options: <code>prefix</code>
and <code>exec_prefix</code>.  By default, both are set to
<code>/usr/local</code>, but these can be overridden by specifying the
correct arguments to configure or by editing
<code>Makefile.local</code>.

Installation copies all necessary header files to
<code>$prefix/include/cvc3</code>. It installs the library
<code>libcvc3</code> in <code>$exec_prefix/lib</code> and the
executable <code>cvc3</code> in <code>$exec_prefix/bin</code>. By
default, a static library and executable are installed.  If you want
to install shared library versions, configure for shared libraries as
described above.

\section faq Frequently Asked Questions

<h3>
Configuration Errors
</h3>

<h4>
<code>libgmp.a is not found</code>
</h4>

Make sure the GMP library is in your <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> and
<code>gmp.h</code> is in your <code>CPATH</code> (or use the
<code>--with-extra-lib</code> and <code>--with-extra-include</code>
arguments to <code>./configure</code>).

If your paths are properly configured and you are compiling for a
64-bit architecture, you may have a 32/64-bit mismatch. Check the
binary type of the GMP library using the <code>file</code>
utility. For example, running <code>file</code> on a 32-bit Linux GMP
shared library will return:

<pre>
    $ file /usr/lib/libgmp.so.3.4.2
    /usr/lib/libgmp.so.3.4.2: ELF 32-bit LSB shared object, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, stripped
</pre>

You can use the <code>--build</code> arguments to
<code>./configure</code> to set the target binary type for %CVC3. For
example, <code>./configure --build=i686-linux-gnu</code> or
<code>./configure --build=x86_64-linux-gnu</code>.

<h4>
<code>Unable to locate Java directories</code>
</h4>

Set the <code>JAVA_HOME</code> environment variable or use the
<code>--with-java-home</code> argument to
<code>./configure</code>. Some typical <code>JAVA_HOME</code> settings
are as follows (where <em>X.Y.Z</em> is the version number of the installed
Java runtime).

<table>
<tr>
<th> Platform    </th><th> <code>JAVA_HOME</code> </th><th> Notes
</th></tr>
<tr>
<td> Debian/Ubuntu Linux </td>
<td> <code>/usr/lib/jvm/default-java</code> </td>
<td> Install the <code>default-jre</code> or 
<code>default-jre-headless</code> package </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>    Fedora Linux     </td>
<td> <code>/usr/java/jre<em>X.Y.Z</em></code> </td>
<td> </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>    Mac OS X         </td>
<td> <code>/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Home</code> </td>

<h3>
Runtime Errors (CVC3 library)
</h3>

<h4>Segmentation fault when running a dynamically-linked executable.</h4>

This can be caused by a mismatched "build type".  The debug and
optimized version of the %CVC3 shared library are not binary
compatible.  If you are linking against a debug version of the shared
library, you must define the symbol _CVC3_DEBUG_MODE during
compilation. E.g., add <code>-D_CVC3_DEBUG_MODE</code> to
<code>CXXARGS</code>.

<h4>Fatal error: <code>Mis-handled the ref. counting</code></h4>

This can be cause by a number of problems. Make sure that all <code>Expr</code>
objects are out of scope or have been manually deleted before deleting
the <code>ValidityChecker</code>.

<h4>
<code>Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no cvc3jni in java.library.path</code>
</h4>

The Java runtime was not able to find the %CVC3 JNI library. Use
<code>java -Djava.library.path=PATH_TO_CVC3JNI</code>, where
<code>PATH_TO_CVC3JNI</code> is the directory containing the file
<code>libcvc3jni.so</code>.

<h4>
<code>Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: libcvc3jni.so.<em>x.y.z</em></code>
</h4>

The Java runtime was not able to satisfy the link dependencies of the
%CVC3 JNI library. Make sure that the %CVC3 and GMP libraries are in
your <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>.

If your paths are properly configured and you are compiling for a
64-bit architecture, you may have a 32/64-bit mismatch. Make sure the
JVM is running in the same mode as the %CVC3 library using the
<code>-d32</code> or <code>-d64</code> argument to <code>java</code>.

<h4>
On Mac: 
<code>terminate called after throwing an instance of 'CVC3::TypecheckException'</code>
</h4>

This appears to be a bug in certain versions of GCC distributed by
Apple. Upgrade to XCode 3.1.2 or later (GCC version "4.0.1 (Apple
Inc. build 5490)") or configure with <code>CXXFLAGS=-01</code>.
